# Virtual Assistant Model Fine-Tuning

## Overview

This project involves fine-tuning a virtual assistant model using a custom dataset. The model is designed to respond to user queries in a conversational manner, providing relevant information while avoiding repetitive and undesirable responses.

## Features

- **Conversational AI**: The model can engage in dialogue and answer a variety of questions.
- **Custom Dataset**: The model is fine-tuned on a dataset that includes diverse prompts and responses, as well as examples of undesirable responses to avoid.
- **Extensible**: The dataset can be easily updated to include new prompts and responses as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- `transformers` library
- `datasets` library
- `torch` library
- `accelerate` library (version 0.26.0 or higher)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install transformers datasets torch accelerate
```

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd project-directory
```

2. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   Ensure that the `cleaned_data.json` file is located in the `refinement/` directory. This file should contain the prompts and responses for training the model.

3. **Run the Fine-Tuning Script**:
   Execute the fine-tuning script to train the model on the custom dataset.

```bash
   python refinement/fine_tune_model.py
```

   The fine-tuned model will be saved in the `results/` directory.

## Usage

After fine-tuning, you can use the model in your application to respond to user queries. You can load the fine-tuned model and tokenizer as follows:

python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
model_name = "./results" # Path to the fine-tuned model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
